## The Mission
Documenting my transition from Cloud User to **Cloud Operator**. Currently mastering the Linux terminal (Ubuntu/WSL2), Git version control, and secure file systems.


### Project Goal
 To document my hands-on mastery of Cloud Infrastructure, starting from the local terminal and moving toward automated cloud deployments. This repo serves as my "Proof of Work" as I transition into a Cloud Engineering role.
