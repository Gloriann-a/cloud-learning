# 🚀 Phase 1: The Linux & Git Foundations

## Project Goal
Transitioning from "Cloud-only" to mastering the underlying Operating Systems that power AWS and Azure.

## 🛠️ Technical Progress
- **Secure Authentication:** Configured SSH key handshakes for GitHub.
- **Environment:** Successfully integrated WSL2 (Ubuntu) with VS Code.
- **Security:** Mastering Linux File Permissions (chmod) to secure local environments.

## 💡 Why this matters
 Understanding the OS is the "Engine" of the Cloud. I'm learning to be an Operator, not just a User.
